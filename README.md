## BasicVersionControl-task

# Explain version control.
Version control is a system for tracking and managing changes to a set of files or documents. It's used in software development, but it can also be applied to other types of work, like writing or editing. The basic idea is to keep track of different versions of a document, so you can go back to a previous version if you need to.

# Explain difference between git and github
Git is a version control system, while GitHub is a website that hosts Git repositories. So, Git is the tool you use to track changes to your files, and GitHub is a place where you can store your Git repositories online
